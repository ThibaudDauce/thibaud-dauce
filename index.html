      <p>I'm an <strong>engineering student</strong> at INSA of Rouen, specialized in computer science and more precisely data mining. I'm currently carrying my last internship before my diploma!</p>

      <p>I started to build websites 9 years ago, mostly for non-profit organizations, but also prototypes for my numerous ideas. I daily use PHP, <strong>Laravel</strong> and Git.</p>

    <p>I founded my company with some friends one year ago after working as a non-profit organization during 3 years. Quantic Telecom is an <strong>internet service provider</strong> that respects net neutrality and works for people who have been forgotten by the large national operators.</p>

    <p>I'm currently working on our new information system with the <strong>Laravel framework</strong>. It manages a lot of useful tools (subscriptions, support, payment…) to improve our productivity. Unfortunately, the source code isn't released under an open source license, but it will be soon. I love to use <strong>beautiful patterns</strong> and <strong>great architectures</strong>.</p>

    <p>Last summer, I carried a 3-month internship at Adludio, a London-based startup working on the next generation of mobile advertising. I enjoy working with modern tools like AWS and Docker.</p>

    <p>During this period, I've developed a software in <strong>Python</strong> to clean data thanks to anomaly detection and played with <strong>D3.js</strong> for some visualizations. I've also handled the change from their old <strong>Event Store</strong> NoSQL database to a new architecture involving <strong>Amazon Kinesis</strong> and <strong>Amazon S3</strong>. I designed an interface for either batch (S3) or real time (Kinesis) analysis in <strong>NodeJS</strong>.</p>

    <img src="/images/libon.png" alt="Libon.">

    <p>Libon is a mobile service designed to improve the communication we have with the people who matter. I've worked in a team of 5 students 22 hours a week during one year for their data scientist team.</p>

    <p>We built a prototype using <strong>Apache Spark</strong> and <strong>GraphX</strong> to discover communities in their social network. I learned <strong>Scala</strong> and I develop a strong interest in functional programming and <strong>distributed algorithms</strong>. We've also used Zeppelin to visualize data.</p>

    <img src="/images/free-software.png" alt="Free software.">

    <p>I'm not a free software fanatic but I try <strong>to keep an eye on my personal data</strong>. I started with Ubuntu 4 years ago, I'm now working on Archlinux. I quit Facebook two years ago and I try to keep my distance with Google (but it's really hard!). Except when it's absolutely required, I prefer self-hosted solution than cloud computing.</p>

    <p>I love to discover new technologies: I tried ReactJS, HHVM, Twister, Rust and a lot more. I'm always looking for new skills to learn.</p>
